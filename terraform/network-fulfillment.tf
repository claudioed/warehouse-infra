# network-fulfillment — the fleet's Anti-Corruption Layer to an external
# retail network (Amazon Vendor Direct Fulfillment). The chart lives in its
# own repo; this file is the environment overlay.
#
# It now HAS a database (its NetworkOrder aggregate carries the 24h
# acknowledgement deadlines the sweep enforces, and an in-memory repo forgets
# them on the restart every pod here takes at rollout). It is still NOT in
# `local.services`, deliberately: membership there also implies the analytics
# projector/reports apparatus, the Kafka wiring and the per-service chart
# shape none of which exist here, and moving it in would recreate the
# resources this file already owns. So the database is wired explicitly
# below, mirroring services.tf's pattern rather than inheriting it.
#
# THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS FILE IS WHAT IT DOES NOT SET.
#
# `config.networkMode` is left at the chart's "stub" default, deliberately
# and permanently for the local kind cluster. In stub mode the service makes
# no external calls, needs no credentials, and creates no Secret — so this
# cluster cannot acknowledge a real retailer's order, and `terraform apply`
# never needs an SP-API credential to exist anywhere. A future real-network
# environment sets networkMode + credentials.existingSecret in ITS overlay,
# not here. The chart itself refuses to render a non-stub mode without
# credentials rather than producing a pod that dies with
# CreateContainerConfigError (see its tests/test_credential_wiring.py).
#
# DECIDED 2026-09-26: no local build. This repo's `docker-publish` CI job
# publishes to GHCR (ghcr.io/claudioed/network-fulfillment), including a
# `:latest` tag on every merge to main -- pulled straight from there now,
