# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Provider wiring.
#
# The kubernetes/helm providers are configured from kind_cluster's credential
# ATTRIBUTES rather than from a kubeconfig file path, and that choice is load
# bearing.
#
# A `config_path` pointing at a file the cluster has not written yet is racy:
# Terraform evaluates a provider node early in the graph walk, before the
# resources that depend on it, so on a clean apply the file does not exist yet
# and both providers silently fall back to their default host — producing
# `Post "http://localhost/api/v1/namespaces": EOF` rather than an honest error.
# A `depends_on` on the *resource* does not help, because it is the *provider*
# that needs the ordering.
#
# Referencing kind_cluster.warehouse.* instead creates a real dependency edge
# from the provider node to the cluster resource, so Terraform configures these
# providers only after the cluster exists. That is what makes a single
# `terraform apply` work from clean state.
