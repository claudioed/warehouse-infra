# is a decision rather than an oversight:
#
#   * The services' OTLP exporters are non-blocking. A service whose collector
#     is absent buffers, fails the export, and keeps serving; it does not fail
#     to start. Making the app releases wait on a Collector would invent a
#     startup dependency the application code specifically avoids having.
#   * `terraform apply -var=deploy_observability=false` therefore leaves a
#     fully working cluster, and bringing the stack up later needs no restart
#     of anything in warehouse-systems.
#
# The one thing that IS a contract between the two halves is the DNS name
# `otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317` (local.otlp_grpc_endpoint,
# `terraform output otlp_endpoint`), which each service repo points its own Helm
# values at. That wiring lives in the service repos, not here.
